<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>"Hey, it's great to meet you! I'm Raeen Fatima, a BCA student who's currently diving into the
   exciting world of HTML and working on my portfolio project. I'm super passionate about learning 
   and exploring new technologies, and I'm thrilled to showcase my skills through my projects.
    Speaking of which, I have two awesome projects under my belt: 'Birthday Invite' and 'Movie Ranking'. 

</p>

<p>With 'Birthday Invite', I aimed to create a visually stunning and interactive invitation platform that captures
   the joy and excitement of celebrating special occasions. On the other hand, 'Movie Ranking' is a project
    where I focused on developing a user-friendly application that allows movie enthusiasts to discover 
    and rate their favorite films.

<p>
  Being a student of technology, I'm continually seeking ways to merge my technical knowledge with my creative flair.
   I believe that combining these two elements can result in truly innovative and impactful projects.
    I'm always up for a challenge and love pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
